# Comparative Genomics Pipeline 
## Citrus canker project

This pipeline was created to develop RPA (Recombinase polymerase amplification) primers for detecting _Xanthomonas._ _citri_ pv. _citri_ and _X. fuscans_ pv. _aurantifolii_ causal agents of citrus canker disease. The basic outline of the pipeline is found in the file "Overview of comparative genomics pipeline for _Xanthomonas_ spp.". 

This pipeline uses 4 Python-based software tools: pyani, prokka, roary, and fasta2primer. Each folder contains the script for running the desired package and the results I obtained from the Xanthomonas comparative genomic analysis. The BLASTn results of the expected amplicons obtained from primers developed by fasta2primer are located in the BLASTn Results folder.

This pipeline is available for comparing **bacterial** genomes and designing RPA or PCR primers.
