# Comparative Genomics Pipeline 
## Citrus canker project

This pipeline was created to develop RPA (Recombinase polymerase amplification) primers for detecting _Xanthomonas._ _citri_ pv. _citri_ and _X. fuscans_ pv. _aurantifolii_ causal agents of citrus canker disease. The basic outline of the pipeline is found in the file "Overview of comparative genomics pipeline for _Xanthomonas_ spp.". 

This pipeline uses 4 Python-based software tools: pyani, prokka, roary, and fasta2primer. Each folder contains the script for running the desired package and the results I obtained from the Xanthomonas comparative genomics analysis.

This pipeline is available for comparing **bacterial**, viral, or archaeal genomes and designing RPA or PCR primers.
